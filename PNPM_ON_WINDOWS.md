# Running Commerce Layer Apps with pnpm on Windows

When working on Microsoft Windows, we suggest to use the PowerShell terminal or any alternative shell with the ability to run scripts as admin user.

This is required to install `pnpm` following the instruction [here](https://pnpm.io/installation#on-windows).

Once done, install globally the `touch-cli` package by running `pnpm add -g touch-cli` in order to successfully execute the `prepare` script (where provided).

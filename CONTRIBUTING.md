```

3. Install the dependencies and configure all environments as described in the project's README.

4. Create a new branch like so:

```bash
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```

5. Make your change, add tests, and ensure the tests still pass.

6. Push to your fork and create a pull request ([learn how to do this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)).
